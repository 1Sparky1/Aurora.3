  - backend: Deletes the lines of code for the descriptions of the upgraded versions
      of micro manipulators, matter bins and micro lasers, since they were identical

  Founded by BurgerBB, tweaked and improved by PoZe:
  - tweak: Lighters can set people on fire when used if the person is covered in fuel.
      Towels can help extinguish flames slightly more effectively than patting people
      out.
  - bugfix: Fire Extinguishers are good at taking out fires. Foam solution is 3 time
      stronger than water.
  - tweak: Drop rolling in extinguisher foam uses foam to extinguish fire.
  - balance: Atmos suit max temperature threshold was increased from 30k to 40k. Atmos
      firefighter suit max temperature was increased from 30k to 45k. Heavy firesuit
      max temperature was increased from 30k to 55k. Same goes for their helmets
  - balance: Firesuits and red/white/atmos hardhats no longer protect wearer from
      pressure. So people cannot use it in space. For areas with 2000+ KPa fire people
      need to use atmos voidsuit.
  - tweak: Cyborg recharge station now refills fire extinguisher in all cyborgs.
  - tweak: Fire now produces CO2 with rate varing by amount of fire.

  Furrycactus:
  - maptweak: Sublevel has received some quality of life improvements for Engineers,
      predominantly involving Atmospherics, but also with the Tesla and airlocks.
  - maptweak: Atmospherics was made larger, now has a large tank for N2O, and was
      also given a large tank for custom gas mixes. A gas heater was also added alongside
      the previous gas cooler, an engineering console with remote Air Alarm Control
      was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency
      of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things
      to actually do.
  - maptweak: The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart
      viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power
      cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components
      now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and
      made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid
      SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can
      output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the
      station on its own, and then some.
  - maptweak: Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line
      with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks.
      They were very prone to becoming stuck due to a lack of air, this should help
      stop that and make using said airlocks more viable.
  Furrycactus, AmoryBlaine:

  - rscadd: Scientists and Xenobiologists have access to an alternate outfit from

  Furrycactus, Doxxmedearly:
  - maptweak: The month of a certain over-commercialised holiday and tacky decorations
      has begun. NanoTrasen has seen fit to leave no public hall, break room, Head
      of Staff (+Quartermaster, how generous) office spared of holiday decor, and
      no Civilian department workspace bare of tacky flashing holiday lights. They
      even put a gaudily decorated tree in the bar, with gifts layed under it every
      shift, and all of the special grass and astroturf on the station has been replaced
      with Authentic(tm) Snow! Show some holiday spirit, and spend money on the newest
      flashiest devices for your friends and family.
  - tweak: Removed trash and added new items to list of contents for xmas gifts.
  - tweak: Cleaned up the list of gift givers by removing some memes and adding new
      names.
  - tweak: Gifts will spawn randomly as small, medium, or large.
  Furrycactus, Ferner, Happy_Fox:
  - maptweak: NanoTrasen finally began decorating for Christmas time, everyone&#x27;s
      favourite commercial holiday. There were some delays due to the whole war and
      everything, but nothing will stop the Christmas cheer. Not even the mix-up from
      the fake-snow guy that&#x27;s led to piles of Moghean sand filling the greenery
      areas. Whatever. Surely Unathi and people who usually celebrate the holiday
      during the Summer will be pleased.
  - imageadd: Added some additional gift sprites by Happy_Fox
  Furrycactys:
  - maptweak: Altered the layout of disposals on the sublevel so that they all lead
      to the crusher. Virology and Xenobiology disposals still lead to space.

      and Cloth Footwraps were also added to the Xeno Wardrobe on the Surface.
  - maptweak: Wires in Tesla Bay were changed slightly to prevent an annoying power
      alarm when the Tesla isn&#x27;t set up.
  - maptweak: Added two more maglights, crowbars, and radios to the Security equipment
      room so Cadets and Officers don&#x27;t need to fight over them.
  - maptweak: The window into space in the Atmospherics port station has been replaced
      with a wall so such a huge area doesn&#x27;t always get vented due to carp.

  Geeves, Kyres:

      externally either.
  - tweak: Brain lobotomization has been renamed to be brain preparation.

      #1526672. Please don&#x27;t let it happen again.'

      The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won&#x27;t clean

      works on the new farmbots, too.'

  - tweak: CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and
      can work with or without mouth-to-mouth.
  - rscadd: Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and
      zombies are exceptions.
  - rscadd: Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not
      have oxygen for quite a while.
  - rscadd: Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don&#x27;t have
      much oxygen, then you&#x27;ll get the effects of low blood.
  - rscadd: Toxins now directly target organs. They&#x27;ll try to destroy the liver
      and kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.

      liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the
      heart pumps blood and so on.

      shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart

  - rscadd: Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends
      on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole
      cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.
  - rscadd: When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can
      be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they&#x27;ll
      just go into asystole again.
  - rscadd: Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact,
      do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!

      1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.
  - rscadd: Dexalin and dexalin+ no longer straight up heal oxyloss. Instead, they
      now fool your brain into thinking that it has 50% oxygen and 80% oxygen respectively.

  - rscadd: Added a stomach organ. This controls reagent ingestion and food ingestion.

      people&#x27;s stomach.
  - tweak: Peridaxon now heals brain damage, if it&#x27;s not damaged much at all.

      reagents from the blood.
  - rscadd: New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.
  - rscadd: Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the
      dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.
  - rscadd: Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.
  - rscadd: Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it
      is now a subtype.
  - rscadd: Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.
  - rscdel: Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like
      brute and burn damage, boys.
  - rscadd: Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like
      a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.
  - tweak: Soulstones work only when someone&#x27;s in asystole.
  - tweak: Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.
  - tweak: Most organs can now take more punishment.
  - tweak: The head is now harder to hit.
  - tweak: The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area
      you hit.
  - tweak: Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you&#x27;re awake.
  - tweak: Self surgery works again.
  - tweak: Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it&#x27;ll
      also lower the organ&#x27;s max damage as well.

      It has two pocket slots. Available in the loadout under the jacket selection.
  MattAtlas:
  - rscadd: When you input a message to announce through the Command console, your
      character now speaks the message, which gets recorded and then replayed as the
      announcement. This means that auto-hiss will translate over to your announcements!
  - maptweak: Moved the requests console in the first responder bay.
  - bugfix: The crew armoury carbines no longer spawn with full-fat 5.56.
  Omicega:
  - tweak: Reinforced windows now drop more materials when broken.
  SleepyGemmy:
  - tweak: Updates the status tab date to follow ISO 8601.
  - maptweak: Adds some missing tiles to the holodeck.
  - tweak: Renames &quot;Syndicate Cyborg&quot; to &quot;Combat Robot&quot; to better
      reflect its purpose.
  - tweak: Renames the adminspawn &quot;Combat Robot&quot; to &quot;Military Robot&quot;.
  - tweak: Removes the on-death explosion from the combat robot.
  - tweak: Tweaks the mounted netgun from 1 to 2 shots. Reduces its recharge time
      slightly.
  - tweak: Tweaks the mounted submachinegun to do a bit more AP, so it is more usable
      against armoured opponents.
  - rscdel: Removes the derelict.dm away site, i.e. the big, empty derelict.
  TheDanseMacabre:
  - rscadd: Four navigation consoles have been added throughout the ship, to allow
      people outside the bridge to know where the ship actually is.
  - tweak: The three .45s in the emergency armory have been replaced with six 10mm
      pistols.
  WickedCybs:
  - tweak: The blackbox and the common server in telecomms had their positions swapped
      so people can repair the common server easier.
  - tweak: Extended the fore hallway area to the spot between the bar and kitchen.
      It used to all be considered a bar area, so those lights would start off and
      It&#x27;d all be enveloped in darkness.
  - tweak: The central primary hallway was considered a singular area all way from
      the entrance to operations to the giant room with the stargazer. The stargazer
      area in particular is now considered a different area, which will stress out
      the poor singular APC that&#x27;s been powering it all far less, as it has its
      own APC now.
