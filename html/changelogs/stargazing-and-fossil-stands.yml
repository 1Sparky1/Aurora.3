changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a mechanic for stargazing, requiring you to be outside in low light, favourable weather and lying down. Skrell are better at this than other species. Alternatively you can stargaze while in view of space, and by examining space."
  - rscadd: "Added telescopes, which let you spot all constellations visible from your location. One is available in research EVA storage."
  - rscadd: "Added fossil stands for displaying fossils. There are small ones - able to display shells and plants - in xenoarchaeology and the library, with a large one for building a model skeleton in xenoarchaeology."
