				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel has received some quality of life improvements for Engineers, predominantly involving Atmospherics, but also with the Tesla and airlocks.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Atmospherics was made larger, now has a large tank for N2O, and was also given a large tank for custom gas mixes. A gas heater was also added alongside the previous gas cooler, an engineering console with remote Air Alarm Control was added, Pipe Dispensers were added, and the overall roundstart efficiency of the setup was reduced in order to give Atmospheric Technicians more things to actually do.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The Tesla Engine was given a few tweaks to make it equally roundstart viable as the Supermatter. The Tesla Bay APC was given a super-capacity power cell in place of a regular power cell, and the Particle Accelerator components now start already in-place and in correct order. Wires were also tidied up and made neater; this should make setting it up more time efficnent. Tesla Grid SMES was upgraded to match the roundstart Supermatter Grid SMES so that it can output power on-par with the Supermatter. It is fully capable of powering the station on its own, and then some.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Sublevel airlocks have been connected to the station air supply line with a gas pump, like the airlocks in mining, solars, and the surface docks. They were very prone to becoming stuck due to a lack of air, this should help stop that and make using said airlocks more viable.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don&#x27;t let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer&#x27;s hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won&#x27;t clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Announcements now only show up to the affected Z-levels.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Barricades have been ported from CM-SS13! You can build steel, wood and plasteel barricades through the respective material build menus. Plasteel barricades can be flipped to allow entry. Additionally, you can link one or more plasteel barricades together with a crowbar to make them flip open at the same time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added barbed wire as a stack item, made from steel. You can use it to wire barricades, preventing climbing. Barbed barricades also deal damage to simple mobs or human mobs that try to slice barricades open with their hands, such as zombies.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added liquidbag barricades. They&#x27;re bags filled with non-Newtonian liquid! You can find them in the crew armoury and the normal armoury, along with barbed wire to set on them. These can be set down by everyone. Use crowbars to disassemble these.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Calling a distress beacon now prompts the first person to swipe for a message. This message will then pop up as a distress beacon to all other Overmap ships.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a distress beacon button to the cockpit of every offmap ship. It only requires one person to press it, but otherwise works just like the keycard authentication option.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The PEAC has been moved to the standard Security armoury.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bullets now ping off of walls, structures and machinery! Try it out. It&#x27;s a cool effect. Ported from CM-SS13.</li>

			<h3 class="author">MattAtlas, MoondancerPony, Geeves updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">An entirely new medical system! Holy balls that&#x27;s a lot of changes.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Pain has been SUBSTANTIALLY changed. It now depends on total damage to all your limbs.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Traumas no longer happen due to oxyloss.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Inaprovaline has been renamed to norepinephrine and viceversa.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CPR has been fixed up a bit. It has a small chance to restart hearts and can work with or without mouth-to-mouth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans no longer die when hitting 200 damage. Dionae, IPCs, grues and zombies are exceptions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans now die when their brain dies. For the brain to die, it must not have oxygen for quite a while.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Suffocation damage is now a modifier to blood. If you don&#x27;t have much oxygen, then you&#x27;ll get the effects of low blood.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Toxins now directly target organs. They&#x27;ll try to destroy the liver and kidneys first... then move onto other organs. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All organs in the body now work towards making sure the brain lives. The liver filters toxins, the kidneys do the same, the lungs provide oxygen, the heart pumps blood and so on.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Humans now have two new stats: blood oxygenation and blood pressure, shown on sensors and scanners. Blood pressure depends on how well your heart is pumping your blood. Blood oxygenation depends on how well your blood is oxygenated.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Your heart can now stop when your pulse is too high. Your pulse depends on many factors - like pain or how much blood your brain wants. A heart in asystole cannot pump blood, meaning your brain will suffocate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When your heart stops, you go into asystole, aka flatlining. This can be fixed with CPR. Make sure that you fix the causes first... or they&#x27;ll just go into asystole again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Norepinephrine stabilizes your heartrate. This is a VERY important fact, do NOT forget this. Norepinephrine will be your best tool!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tricordazine recipe is now 1u epinephrine 1u dylovene.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Adrenaline has been added. Its recipe is 1u norepinephrine 1u hyperzine 1u dexalinplus.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bicaridine recipe is now 1u norepinephrine 1u carbon.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Inaprovaline recipe is now 1u atropine 0.1u phoron 1u adrenaline.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Paroxetine recipe is now 1u mindbreaker 1u acetone 1u norepinephrine.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Nightlife recipe is now 1u methylphenidate 1u synaptizine 1u nitroglycerin.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RMT recipe is now 1u potassium 1u norepinephrine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ondansetron, a chemical that prevents vomiting and nausea, is made with 1u antihistamine 1u synaptizine 1u water.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dexalin and dexalin+ no longer straight up heal oxyloss. Instead, they now fool your brain into thinking that it has 50% oxygen and 80% oxygen respectively.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Alkysine now only heals the brain if it&#x27;s properly oxygenated.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stomach organ. This controls reagent ingestion and food ingestion.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stomach pump mode to sleepers to pump INGESTED reagents out of people&#x27;s stomach.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Peridaxon now heals brain damage, if it&#x27;s not damaged much at all.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dylovene no longer outright heals toxin damage. Instead, it removes toxin reagents from the blood.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New side effects to most healing chems. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Deltamivir now inflicts a fever. Be careful, going overboard with the dosage can give you a pretty bad one. Try not to go over 20 units at once.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bicaridine now gives you muscle spasms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Kelotane makes you drop your held items. Dermaline does the same, as it is now a subtype.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Throwing beakers now shatters them. Be careful.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Numbers have been deleted from scanners. Mostly. Stop using terms like brute and burn damage, boys.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Taking a good chunk of damage at once now produces adrenaline. Acts like a painkiller and raises your pulse. Might also restart your heart.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Soulstones work only when someone&#x27;s in asystole.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed how getting organ damage works. Lasers now deal organ damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Most organs can now take more punishment.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The head is now harder to hit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The organ damage dealt now depends on the size of the organ in the area you hit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Surgery pain is MUCH higher if you&#x27;re awake.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Self surgery works again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using a scalpel on necrotic organs now fixes the necrosis. However, it&#x27;ll also lower the organ&#x27;s max damage as well.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The emergency services dock isn&#x27;t just limited to the ERT TCFL shuttle anymore. The OX ship, TCFL third party shuttle and Kataphract shuttle should be able to dock to it too now. It&#x27;s also been futureproofed and can be used by most ships with a south facing airlock.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added two SMES subtypes for mappers. One is turned on and has a capacitance coil for autostarted solars, the other is a little less beefy SMES for shuttles. Should be nice for mappers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Had to make fuel ports by default spawn with nothing inside. A subtype with phoron already inside the hatch was made and should be replacing all the fuel ports as of now. This had to be done, as the way it was initalized, hydrogen ports would have 2 fuel tanks inside, one phoron one hydrogen.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moved the hangar landmarks for the OX and TCFL ship as well as the docking landmark on the Horizon for south facing ports. It&#x27;s placed below the airlocks in all cases to better accomodate ship design, as having it to the side was causing issues.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Alkysine and Cataleptinol will now actually heal the brain at varying rates, as opposed to both treating the same amount of low damage.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The default chemical transfer rates of RIG injectors, Medibots and bottles have been reduced to allow more precise dose measurements.</li>
				<li class="tweak">More medical chemicals will appear on medical scans as opposed to being registered as unknown substances.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introducing Butazoline, the dermaline equivalent for treating brute injuries. It cannot treat arterial bleeding like Bicaridine, however.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Saline is now the chief blood restorative medication and only works intravenously at a medium transfer rate.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Iron/Copper/Sulphur pills now restore blood at half their previous rate.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Soy Sauce is now made with salt instead of sulphuric acid.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Brute First-Aid Kits have had their contents shuffled about to include a health analyser and 2 bicaridine pills.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Mercury, Neurapan and Spectrocybin to the random toxins list which can spawn in maintenance or a traitor toxin kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now purchase Sideeffect-Be-Gone autoinjectors from the Traitor Uplink. Combat Medical Kits also contain 1 of these autoinjectors.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pill bottles which spawn at round-start and in kits now have the dosage of the pills on the label to prevent accidental overdoses.</li>
				<li class="spellcheck">Some chemical typos have been fixed. Uncapitalised chemicals have been capitalised.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can find all of the chemical changes on the feedback thread (https://forums.aurorastation.org/topic/14761-full-chem-rework-feedback-thread/) while the chemistry wiki page is out of date.</li>
